YOU FORGOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT

when an object self destructs due to 'halt'
there is some cleanup to do

first the object needs to be removed from the global directory

second all its pending messages need to be handled so that those
objects waiting for a response do not crash because 'waiting
indefinitely on an mvar'

simply write the halt value to each of the waiting output ports

YOU FORGOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT

when an object is self destructing, it needs to respond to all
pending messages with the error value.

you are now doing this, but there is a race condition!

after you are removed from the global directory, some object
may still be about to send you a message. before that you may
write EndOfMessages to your chan. Then at some point the
sender will write a message AFTER that. And it will never be
processed.

To fix this, the sender must lookup and write his message while
holding the global object directory. after the message is written
he can put the global dir back.

of course the destructing object needs to hold the global dir
while handling all pending messages, but youre already doing that.
